1. To create a repo on GitHub, you'll need a GitHub account. Sign in, and on your account page, click the button that says '+New Repository.' Name it; maybe something like my-repo? And now your own repo on GitHub! Next step: clone it locally to your computer. On my-repo's webpage, there's a 'clone URL' in the bottom right; copy it. Open Terminal, which you can find by opening Spotlight [Cmd + Space] and type in 'Terminal'. In the command line, type `git clone [clone-URL]` (that's where you paste the URL you copied), and press enter. That's all! Now your repo is stored on your computer, under your User file.

2. Open source is a philosophy around software development which upholds transparency and customizability for programmers and their programs. This means that programmers who want their programs to be open source make their code available, readable, and able to be experimented upon by anyone who likes.

3. Open source is an amazing boon for anyone who's interested in coding; due to its widespread acceptance, everyone who wants to learn to code better has a number of examples they could use of almost any function of many levels of complexity. It's an agreement that reminds me of the scientific method's effect on the umbrella of human knowledgeâ€” the availability of it all of it allows its expansion to continue ever faster and more efficient. Since so many common problems have already been solved and given to coders through open source, we can get further faster.

4. Licenses are crucial, especially for programmers who want to use and contribute to open source software. Licenses allow the programmer to define their limits and expectations for how they want the code that they're giving to the world to be used. This means they may reserve creative rights, like requesting that credit be given for the idea they had, or they may reserve all rights of reproduction, or none.

5. Repeatedly using git through the command line has helped me enormously. The benefits of tracking changes, and how using git *is* using branches, didn't fully click for me until just recently. Before DBC gave me this granular breakdown, my habit was overwhelmingly to push to master like a fool and treat github basically as a backup Dropbox dupe.

One aha-moment: local repos = directories!

Not exactly this challenge, but I'm still shaky on github pull requests in the command line. Do they exist? If they do exist, are pull requests on the browser more inefficient (what with git workflow in the shell, &c)?

What scares me most about being at DBC?

I know this is a bad answer, but there's no way around it. I'm scared I'll fail. What I learned from Week 1's curriculum took me by surprise two ways: in how interesting I found it, and how much material that's there I know I didn't get.

When I understand and can explain the internal structure of something— anything— a system, a timeline, the power plays and uprisings that led to the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989— I feel a level of mental control over it, and a permanence to it. I get it, and even if  specifics get fuzzy I'll be able to follow that mental map back to clarity. So far, the internal logic of git hasn't been mapped for me, and I can sense how easy it would be to get behind in this curriculum where new systems are introduced almost every 2 weeks.

The only way around that fear of getting left behind, not grasping the core concepts, *isn't* a way around. It's just through. Just have to work to understand it better, more thoroughly, explain it to more people, map it out, get the internal logic to gel in my mind.

So I'm worried about how much of that effort I can sustain over 17 weeks. (Also: I'm worried how much my relationships with my family and loved ones may suffer from DBC's time commitment. Also-also: not exactly stoked about getting up at 6:30 every morning. Hope this winter in Chicago isn't the worst.)

Nonetheless, I know it's a good sign that I find it all so interesting. I'm eager to submit this and start Git Real course on Code School, I swear! And I'm willing to put a lot of faith in the Chorus Frog community- if anyone can understand and empathize with my fears, it'll be you guys. Go far, go together. Good luck everyone.

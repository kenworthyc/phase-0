- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was good to see that I hadn't forgotten the things I'd learned from my previous lessons and teachers. I always got a little thrill from seeing all this encoded text showing up clean on a browser.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
HTML5 is a new beast for me, and my instinct was to use divs for all these sections. I'm still not 100% sure if they're pretty much out in HTML5— from my research, I know <div> tags still exist and function in HTML5, but I'm not sure how accepted they are. That said, it's pleasant to have a tool like the <header> and <footer> tags, which make the content of the website much more explicit in an .html file.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Whoops— I suggested we use the <strong> tag. In the interest of getting as close to the text of the Berkshire Hathaway site as possible, but I wasn't thinking of best practices.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is both freeform and limited. With the different tags, you can insert almost any kind of box into a website and fill it with whatever readable content you want— text, links, images— but if you don't know how to read it, it can seem impenetrable and unintuitive, especially given the number and variety of different elements a new user has to type to get a basic text site up and running.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
* I don't know how much of a trick it is seeing as how it's automated in SublimeText, but keeping tags aligned in with tabbing-out makes my work so much more readable. If I lose a tag or add an extra end tag, the whitespace format helps enormously.
* This is basic. REALLY basic. You might become dumber from reading this "tip". But what goes <sample>HERE</sample> will affect the content of the website. Sometimes I freeze up and can't remember which part of the <a href=""></a> tag appears on the site, and where it takes you to. So that's helped me.

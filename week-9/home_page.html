What did you learn about the DOM?

I learned about the pretty vast host of built-in JS methods for
manipulating elements on the DOM. It drives home just how much
JavaScript was developed for the web and the browser, not as a
programming language (although that's been how we've been learning
it thus far). Manipulating the DOM itself is less hierarchical than
I had imagined— you can easily get specific elements without going
through each descending element.
The way JS can chain together and assign CSS attributes looks a lot
like the way object properties are reassigned.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

The .getElementById("id") option seems enormously popular, since
using .getElementsByClassName("className")[index] or
.getElementsByTagName("tagName")[index] are SUCH a hassle,
since you have to use a loop to affect more than one element—
and the idea behind classes is to have more than one element, so it
sort of boggled my mind that JS didn't have a method to select all of
the elements with a given class.

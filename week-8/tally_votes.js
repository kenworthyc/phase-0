What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
It's not too different from iterating over nested structures in Ruby, but there's an added complexity given that in JS, you access a key or value with the dot or bracket constructor. So, naming the variables appropriately becomes crucial for any amount of readability. It's so easy to get astray from the level or object you're pointing toâ€” my pair and I had to go over that

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
In order to add one vote for a previously not voted-for candidate, we had to be sure there wasn't already a tally for the candidate. So we found a way check for an undefined (nonexistent) prop-value pair, using 'typeof variable === 'undefined' ?'.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
My pair helped a lot with my understanding of the structure of nested for..in loops, and also with the possible ways we could shorten the logic of our code. Realizing that we didn't have to change the values to an array and sort it, but simply assign one variable to one value, and if subsequent values were greater than the variable, reassign to that value.

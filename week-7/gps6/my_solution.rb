# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative calls the information or content from a sibling ruby file.
# require functions in place of a gem, creates an environment in which to work.
require_relative 'state_data'

# Reflection Section
=begin
What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
One hash syntax uses hash rockets (=>) to separate keys and values, while the second
one uses colons (:) to separate keys which are symbols from values. They're still both
perfectly valid hashes.

What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
require_relative references a ruby file that is a 'sibling' file (in the same directory as the working ruby file). On the other hand, require provides more context and more
of an environment to work in, whereas require_relative attaches code or data to use.

What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
You can iterate through a hash using commands like .each and .map, which affect both
the key and value, or methods like .each_key or .each_value, which iterate in relation
to the relevant element.

When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
Since I was solo, my guide Bison helped me understand the instance variables which
were called in the relevant methods, and the extraneous ones which weren't. Otherwise,
I learned that the all-caps variables are a constant, which is a human distinctionâ€” a 'constant' variable in Ruby is just a variable that programmers agree not to touch.

What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
I got more and better practice with iterating through a nested data structure on this challenge, and on working with information on an exterior file.

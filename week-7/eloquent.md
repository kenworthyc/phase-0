INTRO //
Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?

I found it hilarious that JavaScript's name was hanging on the coattails of Java. The history of Javascript and new releases and versions was interesting. I understood all the useful compressions that programming languages do for programmers, and like the idea behind it— that languages do the boring things so programmers can get to the interesting ones.

Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?

I was totally caught off guard by the program broken into binary. I just can't imagine trying to manage information that way. It makes my sense of the state of flow seem totally unreachable. I'm lucky not to have to program like that.

CHAPTER 1 //

Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.

JavaScript and Ruby have several very similar mathematical capabilities (they can perform +, -, * / very well, thank you) and follow the order of operations; notable differences in the way they handle numbers include Ruby's preference for integers over floats. JavaScript's divide (/) operation will return a float if the divisor or dividend is a float, whereas Ruby will return the greatest integer that will divide.

JavaScript has more categories for mathematical possibilities than Ruby; it has a value for Infinity or -Infinity, and a special number type NaN, which stands for Not a Number. You'll get this if you 0/0 in JS. Ruby would kind of freak out about it. (Coincidentally, this is the only value in JS which is not equal to itself, which makes sense because it could be any number of things— just not a number.)

Both JS and Ruby have some neat abilities with escape characters in strings; its escape characters include \n for newlines as well as \t for tabs, which I learned about for the first time.

In JS, 'null' and 'undefined' seem to be more widely applied versions of Ruby's 'nil'. They're all values which carry no information.

CHAPTER 2 //

What is an expression?
What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?
What causes a variable to return undefined?
Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.
What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?
Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.
Describe while and for loops
What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?
Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.

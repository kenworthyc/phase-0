/*
What JavaScript knowledge did you solidify in this challenge?
Still getting into the habit of recognizing syntax errors, defining functions
correctly, and putting semicolons everywhere! It was particularly beneficial
to get into reading MDN's docs for JavaScriptâ€” I didn't actually think JS had
so many built-in methods in the way Ruby does.

What are constructor functions?
Constructor functions create a new object whenever they are called. The object
will be created and be accorded any properties defined within the constructor
function. The constructor function will only create a new object when it is called
with the correct number/type of arguments (not automatically).

How are constructors different from Ruby classes (in your research)?
Constructors are a bit like Ruby classes, but in JS, the parameters of a new
object are defined within the constructor function itself. That is, the attributes
and properties of the object are generated every time the constructor function is run.
(In Ruby classes, the class is created separately from the method that creates the
object [which would be Class.new, *after* the Class was already defined].)

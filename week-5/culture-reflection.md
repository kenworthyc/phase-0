Pairing:

What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?

Despite any differences between my pair and myself, I've always had the greatexperience of meeting in the middle, so to speak. Since we're both first-timers on most of it, and otherwise we're strangers, admitting ignorance isn't as nerve-wracking. Plus, combining the brain power/areas of expertise with different people makes each session interesting.

What aspects of pairing were particularly fun or rewarding?

When I'm working on a problem with a pair (whether driving or navigating) and we're really concentrating on the same problem, thinking through the same steps — that feeling is freeing. Depending on another person as I work is both supporting and motivating— they make my task easier, and make me want to do it better. Reaching that level of communication can't be easy, and I can't say I've experienced with much duration, but the flashes of understanding I have had between a pair and myself are invigorating.

What aspects of pairing were frustrating and difficult?

Aside from the occasional feeling of not getting through to my pair? The most frustrating thing is my own head getting in the way of a fluent pairing session. I'm pretty conscious when my pair is more comfortable with the material than I am, and that makes it hard for me to slow down their thought process with questions (as I also know how that can gum up the creative works).

Feedback:

How did you feel when you read your feedback?

I felt grateful that my pairs paid attention to my state of mind and my contributions. It 's stunning to read my pairs' impressions of how I think and interact when trying to collaborate. On the other hand, I also wish my feedback were more precise. While the community at DBC is immensely supportive, I wish I knew better which aspects of my behavior or communication are inhibiting us.

Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?

The feedback has helped me be more aware of how effectively and efficiently I can communicate in 60-ish minutes, and made me think about what I need as a driver vs. a navigator, and what I can or should provide in those roles.

Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?

I think the most effective way to improve my part of pairing is being more upfront with communication about what I need to contribute to the session. I can work on suppressing my feeling of inferiority when I want to ask questions, and or for a complete breakdown of a part of our code.

How was it to write feedback? What can you do to improve your own feedback?

Writing feedback is pretty familiar for me; I've been consistently involved with workshop-style classes for years. Making kindness a goal in my feedback is newer to me, and I hope my feedback is still accessible to my pairs.

What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?

I hold a lot of importance in concise, effective writing; I think it's respectful of my reader's attention. In my feedback, I tend to cushion my real points with positive observations — which aren't disingenuous, but aren't the focus of my feedback.

Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?

When you have distinct focus on communication and collaborative thought/research, pairing can be a wonderfully compounded way to learn. Having your pair think through a problem can allow your train of thought to follow the tracks they've laid.
Feedback, I think, isn't just a guide to learning— it's the main measuring stick by which people judge if they are learning. Feedback tends to be more environmental or tangential: a vague congratulation from a higher-up, or an assumption or comment that peers make. Focused, specific feedback — A.S.K. feedback — is like our normal feedback on steroids. If you utilize the observations others will make to you, and trust that they're made with good intentions, you can make more purposeful adjustments.

(TLDR; regular feedback is everywhere, DBC feedback is efficient.)

I read the [http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.htm](summaries of the 4 spectrums) on the Index of Learning Styles first, and rather on a whim, I tried to evaluate my opinion of my learning styles. It seems that Here's how I rated myself, followed by the perhaps more quantitative results from [http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html](this quiz):

* Active - Reflective : 50 - 50 | 1 toward Active;  I was pretty close.
* Sensing - Intuitive : 55 - 45 | 5 toward Intuitive;  I had a more intense preference toward the side I didn't predict.
* Visual - Verbal :     30 - 70 | 3 toward Verbal;  I was right on the direction, but not the intensity of preference.
* Sequential - Global : 65 - 35 | 5 toward Global;  I was right on intensity, but not the direction.

This data was interesting to see, particularly because I seemed to have difficulty predicting my demonstrated preferences when I felt more strongly about them. (Although I will say that some of the phrasing of the quiz questions made me want to respond yes to both options.) This quiz reflected that my learning styles aren't terribly pronounced either way, but tend toward the structural and holistic.

Yet a few of the other quizzes from Week 1 told me that I do quite well with sequential thinking, linking one part to the next and then forming a picture of the whole. The odd thing is that both ring true to me. So.. maybe I do have a somewhat balanced learning style.

In the interest of a growth mindset... On instinct, the visual mode of learning seems to be least developed for me. I sense there may be ways for me to access non-linear, imaginative solutions with visual experimentation. Considering I'm markedly interested in front-end web development, not a bad plan.

The fixed vs. growth mindset has been on the back of my mind for the past few weeks. So far, I haven't hit many serious stumbling blocks; this makes me nervous, worried about when the other shoe will drop. I went to a US public schools, and I felt intensely that I needed to get good grades, and mostly I did. As a result, my feedback wasn't huge. The first time I got a B in math I was almost inconsolable. Fixed mindset alarm bells everywhere!

I like to think I've come a long way since then, but in point of fact, I've tended to stick with things that I know I'm good at. In some ways, I'm both freaked out about hitting a wall with more theoretical programming later on in DBC, and weirdly excited to test out and *practice* the growth mindset by leaning into the failure. I'll probably feel differently when the time comes, but I'm hoping mental preparation is worth something.

      Version control is a crucial technology for programmers, especially when working on collaborative projects. It allows for efficient tracking, implementation, and reverting of changes made to a codebase over time.

        Version control is a way for anyone to keep track of all the steps they've taken on a creative project on a computer. "Version control" is particularly popular with programmers, but it's an idea you may have come across as early as elementary school. If you ever had to turn in an outline for a short essay, then turn in a rough draft, and lastly a final version, you essentially broke a task down into parts, had copies of your work on each step, and then completed the task. When you're working on a computer, version control makes it easy to track all your changes on a project. It protects each stage, and lets you reference each change at any point.

      Git is an widely used version control system and was originally created for work on the Linux kernel, one of the most famous open source projects. Git is well known for its speed and efficiency, and its features that allow for many users to collaborate on a project. One of git's most renowned features is its system for leaving messages on "commits" (code changes), which allows collaborators to explain the intention and reasoning behind their work.

      Many git users choose to store their projects on Github. Github is a free git repository hosting service that has many useful tools to promote collaboration between users. Because of these features Github has developed a wide following across the development community, which makes it an appealing place to communicate with colleagues and showcase work. Many well known open source software projects are hosted on Github and developers of all skill levels are active there.

*What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?*

<header>, <footer>, <section>, and <nav> are on just about every page I've drafted with HTML5. <article> is a close fourth, but it depends on the content of the webpage. It's just so nice not to have to class every single div!

*How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?*

Elements are laid out from top to bottom in the order the tags are written. Typically each element starts on a new line, but there no vertical spacing between two elements.

*What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?*

Snippets are rad! It'll be really useful to make basic CSS styling with that tool as well. As for other shortcuts, I definitely used `space + /` to make this comment, so that's a good start. I'm sure there are plenty more to make use of too.

LEARNING METHODS

Fixed v Growth mindset
	Fixed: traits like intelligence and capacity for learning are static
	Growth: traits "" expand in proportion to your willingness to learn


VARK Learning Style: ** multimodal
	Aural -- discuss with others, 'teach' to others
	Read & Write -- definitions, outlines, hierarchical notes
	Kinesthetic -- learn by doing, hands-on approach, examples

Personal Thinking Style:

Concrete/Abstract Sequential thinker: 
I find deep satisfaction in understanding the practical applications of ordered systems, and the theoretical underpinnings of those systems; why they work the way they work, the internal coherence of that logic.


I take copious notes in readable outlines which — at their best — allow me to identify overarching themes or an underlying structure in a lesson. Seeing one subject integrated into a unit of lessons helps me identify a practical trajectory toward mastery, and that typically bolsters my patience and determination to learn each step.

Discussing and confirming the accuracy of my thoughts about a lesson give me a chance to check the foundation of my knowledge. Hearing another person's thought process on the same lesson will often help me cross-reference and buttress my understanding as well.

The visceral experience of doing, creating, revising, and editing gives me a sense of having 'actually' learned the subject. If the practical application reinforces my understanding of the conceptual underpinnings written in my notes, the knowledge clicks right into place.

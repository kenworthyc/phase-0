name: Caroline Kenworthy
location: Chicago (Oak Park)
where & why: Attending DBC in Chicago. I took an intro-level course in web development in my senior year of college, and within a week, I wished I'd started earlier. DevBootcamp seemed to me the best resource to keep going.
what now: I graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in May, and for most of the summer I worked odd jobs and tried to get a handle on what work I wanted to do. I live with my parents, volunteer at a yoga studio, cook, read, and watch movies a lot, and like to camp and rock climb.
most excited to learn: I will be thrilled to understand the theory behind how the arguments in a method plug into it and make it run in Ruby. That said, I'm super interested in front-end development, and want to seriously hone in on HTML (HTML5 particularly) & CSS. I'd love to put together in-browser games too.
